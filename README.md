This repository demonstrates a common yet elusive bug in Firebase applications: data type mismatches when retrieving data from the database. The bug arises when the client-side code anticipates a specific data structure (e.g., a string, number, or object) but receives data of a different type from the Firebase database. This discrepancy can cause unexpected behavior and crashes. The solution showcases how to implement robust error handling and data validation to mitigate such issues.
